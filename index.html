        <h2>Essay</h2>
        <p> The phrase "The thing about new beginnings is that they require something else to end" highlights the bittersweet truth that progress often comes with loss.
             To start something new, we must let go of something old—whether it’s a relationship, a habit, or a familiar way of life. This requires courage, as endings can be painful,
            but they also create space for growth. By embracing the necessity of closure, we open ourselves to fresh opportunities and personal transformation. Ultimately, every new beginning
            carries the potential for a brighter future, even if it comes at the cost of something left behind..</p>
